# IoT-for-Defence-Military

Network centric warfare has been serving the defence mechanism since last few decades. Contemporary network oriented solutions exhibit vertical silos which lack in inefficient connected approach. Internet of Things holds the key potential to interconnect the battlefield with the digital world in ways that promise to fundamentally change military operations. This study proposes a novel architectural framework-IoTNetWar, juxtaposing Internet of Things and Network Centric Warfare together. IoTNetWar presents the integrity between weapons, military personnel, and overall warfare on the conjugation of sensors, gateways, internet, and cloud based services. Few research challenges have also been identified so that researcher may get involved to solve the related issues.

In this literature an loT based framework is presented to cater
the resolve the integrity issues between various sectors of the
defence and military systems. It is needless to say, the
expansion of networks to everyday items carries with it
tremendous risks as well as benefits. Advanced analytics for
continuous monitoring of overall system will be required to be
deployed to make sense of all the data and make decisions
based on it. loTNetWar is a novel architecture which
interconnects all the fundamental aspects of defence
mechanism to loT. Horizontal platforms are envisaged to
overcome the vertical silos associated with existing network
technologies. NWC has efficiently been conceptualized with
support of loT. Few research issues have been identified
which categorically impose the loT to empower by resolving
in terms of significant input. Further, being at its nascent
stage, researchers need to involve in this area to amalgamate
the defence mechanism with loT to build astronger nation
